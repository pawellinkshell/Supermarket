# Supermarket
Demo of Supermarket with simple checkout mechanism created and designed by Jan Koszela.

### Business requirements:
1. Design and implement supermarket checkout component with readable API that calculates the total unit of a number of items.
2. Checkout mechanism can scan items and return actual unit ( is stateful)
3. Our goods are priced individually. In addition, some items are multipriced: buy n of them, and theyâ€™ll cost you y cents
 
  |Item  | Unit Price |  Special Price |
  |:----:|-----------:|---------------:|
  |  A   |  40        | 3 for 70       |
  |  B   |  10        | 2 for 15       | 
  |  C   |  30        |                |
  |  D   |  25        |                |
 
### Non-functional requirements:
1. Clean Code
2. Unit/Integration Tests should be in place
3. Use maven or gradle build system

## Getting Started
* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/pawellinkshell/Supermarket.git`
* Fork the repo

### Prerequisites
To use the source files, you will need to have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) installed globally. Project is built with 3.3.9 version of Maven.

#### To Start:
First thing to do, is prepare the `*.war` file which should be deployed on Tomcat server.
* Run `mvn clean install` in the root directory

#### To run:
* Put already built `Supermarket.war` file in `<TOMCAT>\webapps` directory
* Go to `<TOMCAT>\bin` and run `catalina.bat run` to deploy and run the project

* Alternatively you can run `Supermarket` in your IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse using local instance of Tomcat.
